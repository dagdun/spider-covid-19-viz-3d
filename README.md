<summary>Concept</summary>

The concept of the web page is to show you the current COVID-19 situation around the entire world in 3 seconds or less.

* View the data from John Hopkins University [GitHub repository]( https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data ) in 3D
* Provide entry-level programming code anybody can copy and make better
* Display all the data in seconds on any device then zoom and rotate and click to see the cases in 3D

The progress made in one day of programming was excellent - as you can see above. And there's a lot more features that can be added. For example, why are those blue bars so boring-looking? Or can you show me the borders of the countries?
